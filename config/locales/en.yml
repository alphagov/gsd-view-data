    'transactions-received':
      name: transactions received
      description: These numbers tell you how much the service was used, and which channels were used the most.

    'transactions-ending-in-outcome':
      name: transactions ending in an outcome
      description: These numbers tell you how many transactions the service processed, and how well these transactions met users' needs.

    'calls-received':
      name: calls received
      description: These numbers tell you how much the call centre was used, and why.
      
      If the total number of calls is high then the number of transactions, that’s an indication that effort is high compared to output.
      
If the proportion of users calling to chase progress is high, this might mean that the service isn’t processing transactions as quickly as it should. A high proportion of calls to get more information could indicate that the information available online is incomplete or unclear.
